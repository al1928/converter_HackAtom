on a december afternoon in chicago during the middle of world war two scientists cracked open the nucleus at the centre of the uranium atom and turned on nuclear man into energy over and over again they did this by creating for the first time a chain reaction inside a new engineering marvel the nuclear reactor since then the ability to mine grade amounts of energy from uranium has led some to build nuclear power as a plentiful utopian source of electricity a modern nuclear reactor generate enough electricity from one kilogram of fuel to power an average american household for nearly thirty four years but rather than dominate the global electricity market nuclear power has declined from an all time high of eighteen percent in nineteen eighty six to eleven percent today and it's expected to drop further in the coming decades what happens to the great promise of this technology it turns out nuclear power faces many heard of including high construction costs and public opposition and behind these problems lie a series of unique engineering challenges nuclear power relies on the vision of uranium nuclear i and a controlled chain reaction that produces this splitting in many more nuclear the atomic nucleus is densely packed with protons and neutrons bound by a powerful nuclear force most uranium atoms have a total of two hundred thirty eight protons and neutrons but roughly one in every one hundred forty flax three neutrons and if wider isotope is less type me bad compared to its more abundant cousin a strike by a neutron easily splits the you to thirty five nuclear i in a wider radioactive elements called fission products in addition to two to three neutrons gamma rays in a few new traders during fish and some nuclear mass transforms into energy a fraction of the newfound energy power is the fast moving neutrons and if some of them strike uranium do queer eye surgeon results in a second larger generation of neutrons if this second generation of neutrons strike more uranium nuclear i more vision results in an even larger third generation and so on but inside a nuclear reactor this spiraling chain reaction is tamed using control rods made of elements that captured excess neutrons and keep their number in check with a controlled chain reaction a reactor draws power steadily and stabler for years the neutron where a chain reaction is a potent process driving nuclear power but there's a catch that can result in unique demands on the production of its few it turns out most of the neutrons emitted from fission have too much kinetic energy to be captured by uranium nuclear the fish and rate is to go on the chain reaction fizzled out the first nuclear reactor built in chicago used graphite as a moderator to scatter and slowdown neutrons just enough to increase their capture by uranium and raise the rate of vision maroon reactors commonly used purified water as a marvelous but the scattered neutrons are still a little too fat to compensate and keep up the chain reaction the concentration of you to thirty five is enriched to four to seven times its natural of until today enrichment is often done by passing a gaseous uranium compound for centrifuge to separate wider you to thirty five from heavier you to said yeah but the same process can be continued to highway and rich you to thirty five up to one hundred thirty times it's natural abundance and create an explosive chain reaction in a farm methods like centrifuge processing must be carefully regulated to limit the spread of palm grade few remember only a fraction of the released vision energy goes into speeding up neutrons most of the nuclear power goes into the kinetic energy of the fission products those or captured inside the reactor as heat by a cubans usually purified water this heat is essentially used to drive an electric turbine generator by steam just outside the reactor wonderful is critical narrow me to create a tragedy but also to guard against the most dreaded type of reactor accident the no doubt if water flow stops because a pipe carrying it breaks for the pumps that push it say of the uranium heats up very quickly and notes during a nuclear meltdown radioactive vapor escape into the reactor and if the reactor fails the whole them a steel and concrete containment topic is the last line of defense but if the radioactive gas pressure is too high containment fails and the gases escape into the air spreading as far and wide as the wind works the radio active fission products in newspapers eventually decay into stable elements well some decay in a few seconds others take hundreds of thousands of years the greatest challenge for a nuclear reactor is to safely contained these products and keep them from harming humans or the environment containment doesn't stop murdering wants the few was used up in fact it becomes an even greater storage problem every one to two years some spent you is removed from reactors and stored in pools of water that cool the waist and what is radioactive emissions the irradiated fuel is a mix of uranium that failed decision vision products and plutonium a radioactive material that found in nature of this mix must be isolated from the environment until it has all safely decayed many countries proposed deep time storage in tunnels drove for underground but none have been built and is great uncertainty about the wrong term security how can a nation that has existed for me a few hundred years plane to god plutonium through with radioactive half wife of twenty four thousand years today many nuclear power plants sit on their waste instead storing them indefinitely on sides apart from radioactivity there's an even greater danger with spend a few plutonium can sustain a chain reaction and can be mind from the waist to make paths storing spent fuel is thus narrow me a safety risk for the environment but also a security risk for nations who should be the watchman regarded visionary scientists from the early years of the nuclear age pioneered how to reliably tap the tremendous amount of energy inside and adam as an explosive balm day and as a controlled power source with incredible potential but their successors have learned humbling insights about the technology is not so utopian industrial minutes mining the subatomic will make for complex expensive and risky

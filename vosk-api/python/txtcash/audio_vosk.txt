december afternoon in chicago during the middle of world war two scientists cracked open the nucleus at the center of the uranium atom in turn to nuclear mass into energy over and over again they did this by creating for the first time a chain reaction inside a new engineering marvel the nuclear reactor since then the ability to mind great amounts of energy from uranium nuclei has led some to build nuclear power as a plentiful utopian source of electricity a modern nuclear reactor generate enough electricity from one kilogram of fuel to power and average american household for nearly thirty four years but rather than dominate the global electricity market nuclear power has declined from an all time high of eighteen percent in nineteen ninety six to eleven percent today and it's expected to drop further in the coming decades what happens to the great promise of this technology it turns out nuclear power faces many hurdles including high construction costs and public opposition and behind these problems lie a series of unique engineering challenges nuclear power relies on the fish and of uranium nuclei and it control chain reaction that produces this splitting in many more nuclei the atomic nucleus is densely packed with protons and neutrons bound by a powerful nuclear force most uranium atoms have a total of two hundred thirty eight protons and neutrons but roughly one in every one hundred forty blacks three neutrons and this a lighter isotopes is less tightly about compared to it's more abundant cousin a strike by a neutron easily splits the you to thirty five nuclei into lighter radioactive elements called fission products in addition to two to three neutrons gamma rays and a few neutrinos during fish and some nuclear mess transforms into energy a fraction of the newfound energy powers the fast moving neutrons and if some of them strike uranium nuclei pigeon results in a second larger generation of neutrons if this second generation of neutrons strike more uranium nuclei more fish and results in an even larger third generation and so on but inside a nuclear reactor the spiraling chain reaction is team using control rods made of elements that capture excess neutrons and keep their number in check with a controlled chain reaction a reactor draws power steadily and stay plea for years the neutron lead chain reaction is a potent process driving nuclear power but there's a catch that can result in unique demands on the production of it's fuel it turns out most of the neutrons emitted from suspicion of too much kinetic energy to be captured by uranium nuclei decision rate is too low and the chain reaction fizzles out the first nuclear reactor built in chicago used graphite as a moderator to scatter and slow down neutrons just enough to increase their capture buy uranium and raised the rate of fission modern reactors commonly used purified water but the scattered neutrons are still a little too fast to compensate and keep up the chain reaction the concentration of to thirty five is enriched to four to seven times today in richmond is often done bypassing a gash us uranium compound through centrifuges to separate lighter you to thirty five for heavier you to thirty eight but the same process can be continued to highly enriched you to thirty five up to one hundred thirty times it's natural abundance and create an explosive chain reaction methods like centrifuge processing must be carefully regulated to limit the spread of grade fuel remember only a fraction of the released efficient energy goes into speeding up neutron most of the nuclear power goes into the kinetic energy of decision products those are captured inside the reactor as heat by at coolidge usually purified water actually used to drive an electric turbine generator by steam just outside the reactor water flows critical not only to create electricity but also to guard against the most dreaded type of reactor accident the meltdown if water flow stops because a pipe carrying it breaks for the pumps that pushes sale the uranium heats up to carry quickly melts during a nuclear meltdown radioactive papers escaped into the reactor and if the reactor fails to hold them a steel and concrete containment building is the last line of defense but if the radioactive gas pressure to high containment sales and the gases into the air spreading as far and wide as the wind blows the radioactive fission products in these papers eventually decay into stable while some decay in a few seconds others take hundreds of thousands of years the greatest challenge for a nuclear reactor is to safely contained these products and keep them from harming humans for the environment containment doesn't stop mattering wants to fuel is used up in fact it becomes an even greater storage problem every one to two years substance is removed and stored pools of water cooled a waste and block it's radioactive emissions the irradiated fuel is a mix of uranium that detailed decision fission products and to tony of radioactive material not found in nature this mix must be isolated from the environment until it has all safely decade many countries proposed time storage drilled underground but none have been built and there is great uncertainty about their long term security how can a nation that has existed for only a few hundred years plane to guard tony of through it's radioactive slice of twenty four thousand years today many nuclear power plants set on their waste instead storing them indefinitely on site apart for radioactivity there's an even greater danger which she will tony of can sustain a chain reaction and can be mined from the waist to make a story is us not only a safety risk for the environment but also securing for nations who should be to watch to guard at scientists from the early years of the nuclear age pioneered to reliably tapped a tremendous amount of energy inside as an explosive as a control tower source incredible potential but their successors of learn tumbling insights about the technology not so utopian industrial mining this sub atomic make for complex expensive engineer on
